# Practice Echo

I started from a volume-meter demo at
https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter.git and, with my limited
front-end skills added on a "quiet detector" that triggers record and playback of
microphone audio input.

You can either play a passage of music with your instrument into the
practice echo or just sit there and do "I know you are, but what am
I?" until you get tired of it.

The primary intent is to help you refine intonation or tonal quality
through drilling and listening to yourself.
