# Practice Echo

The primary intent is to help you refine intonation or tonal quality
through drilling and listening to yourself.

You can either play a passage of music with your instrument into the
practice echo or just sit there and do "I know you are, but what am
I?" until you get tired of it.

The main feature is a "quiet detector" that triggers the start and stop of the recording via the
microphone input.
